font-weight: lighter;"> A brief information</h1>

<p>I was born and raised in Baghdad/Iraq. <br>
At 4:00 A.M on 18 of August 1993,
( I guess I was born an early bird ).<br>
finished my high school in Baghdad, went to college in 2011.<br>
In 2014 I met a beautiful woman and we fell in love,<br>
now we are together with the sacred bond of marriage.<br>
Got my B.D.S of dental surgery in 2016,<br>
however, after five years of practicing my medical occupation,<br>
I decided to do a career change.<br>
this new practice that I picked up during COVID-19 quarantine<br>
it was graphic design, then I decided to switch to coding,<br>
in which I really found my self.</p>

<hr>

<p>Though I am still a beginner, I think I was born to code, <br>
to build beautiful websites and to share<br>
my logical thinking with this world.<br>
that being said, I find my happiness in traveling, camping<br>
and sharing with friends and family.</p>
